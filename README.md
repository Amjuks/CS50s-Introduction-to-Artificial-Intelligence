## About CS50 AI 2023

[CS50 AI](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2023/) is Harvard University's introduction to artificial intelligence, exploring foundational concepts such as machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, and the ethical implications of AI. This course emphasizes practical applications and hands-on projects to develop skills in AI programming and problem-solving.

## My Journey

I started my CS50 AI journey after completing CS50x, by my desire to explore the world of Artificial Intelligence. Initially, I faced delays in diving back in due to my focus on schoolwork. It wasn't an easy path, but my eagerness for learning AI inspired me to return and balance my academic responsibilities.

Throughout the CS50 AI course, I learned a wide range of topics, from the basics of search algorithms to advanced topics such as neural networks (NN) and natural language processing (NLP). This showcase highlights the projects I completed during my journey, awarding in a certificate of completion.

Since then, I have continued to self-learn AI concepts through platforms like Kaggle. One of my key interests is image generation. So far, I have successfully created a handwritten digits and scenic image generators, and a handwritten digits identifier.

This journey has deepened my passion for AI, and I look forward to exploring even more in this exciting field!

## Certificate

I successfully completed the CS50 AI 2023 course and obtained a certificate of completion. You can view my certificate [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/certificates/acca82e5-8b15-4f7e-b9b6-7090bd969ce5.png).

## Projects Overview

### Week 0: Search

1. **Degrees**:
   
    To find the shortest path between two actors in Hollywood by identifying a sequence of films they’ve both starred in, using a breadth-first search algorithm to connect them through shared roles.

2. **Tic-Tac-Toe**:

    To create a playable Tic-Tac-Toe game where players can compete against an AI that makes optimal moves using a minimax algorithm.

### Week 1: Knowledge

1. **Knights**:
   
    To determine the identity of characters in “Knights and Knaves” puzzles by representing their statements in propositional logic and using a model-checking algorithm.

2. **Minesweeper**:
   
    To create a Minesweeper game where an AI can autonomously play by making moves to uncover squares and deducing the locations of hidden mines.


### Week 2: Uncertainty
1. **Heredity**:

    To infer the probability distribution of genes and the likelihood of individuals exhibiting particular traits based on their parental information and observable traits within a population.

2. **PageRank**:
   
    To implement an AI that finds the PageRank of web pages, determining their relative importance within a network.

### Week 3: Optimization
1. **Crossword**:
   
    To create an AI that generates crossword puzzles.

### Week 4: Learning
1. **Nim**:
   
    To create an AI that learns to play Nim using reinforcement learning techniques.

2. **Shopping**:
   
    To develop an AI that predicts whether customers will complete an online purchase.

### Week 5: Neural Networks
1. **Traffic**:
   
    To create an AI that identifies traffic signs in photographs.

### Week 6: Language

1. **Parser**:

    To develop an AI that parses sentences and extracts noun phrases.

2. **Questions**:
   
    To create an AI that answers questions by retrieving relevant information from a text corpus.
